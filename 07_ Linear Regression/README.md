### Working Of Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a Regression-based algorithm under Supervised Learning. In Regression the target label is in continuous numerical data type.

To understand Linear Regression consider an example to predict the Blood Pressure of the patients. Here Drug Dosage is a feature and Blood Pressure is the label. Now plot Dosages vs Blood Pressure data on a Scatter Plot. In order to predict the target variable on new data, we must have to train and predict the model with the provided dataset. The formula used to predict the target label for unseen data is given:

```
y_pred = WÃ—feature_data + bias
```

By applying the formula we get the predicted value. There shall definitely be a difference between the actual value and predicted value and this difference is known as Loss error. The loss function is defined as the sum of the square of the difference between the actual value and the predicted value.
